# odoo-custome-addons

Done so far:
Created three users: HR, Supervisor, Employee

HR can create templates for different Employees using Evaluation Group
Depending on evaluation group, employees can see their own plan.

HR can activate PMS cycle
Can choose cycle type and then select employees (All / manually select)

After HR activates cycle, employee can see their own planning form
Employee fills up planning form and submits to supervisor
Supervisor can either reject or approve
If rejected, employee needs to fill form again
If approved, planning is done for the said employee
